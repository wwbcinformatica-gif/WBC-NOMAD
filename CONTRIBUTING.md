## Code of Conduct

Please read and review our full [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing. In short: please be respectful and considerate in all interactions with maintainers and other contributors.

We are committed to providing a welcoming environment for everyone. Disrespectful or abusive behavior will not be tolerated. 

---

## Before You Start

**Open an issue first.** Before writing any code for a non-trivial change, you must [open an issue](../../issues/new) to discuss your proposed change. This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures your contribution aligns with the project's direction. **Pull requests submitted without a corresponding issue may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.**

**Trivial fixes are exempt** and may be submitted directly as a PR. Examples:
- Typo and grammar corrections
- Documentation clarifications
- Small one-line bug fixes with an obvious cause

If you're not sure whether your change qualifies as trivial, open an issue first.

When opening an issue:
- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Describe the problem you're solving or the feature you want to add
- If it's a bug, include steps to reproduce it and as much detail about your environment as possible
- Ensure you redact any personal or sensitive information in any logs, configs, etc.

## Getting Started with Contributing
**Please note**: this is the Getting Started guide for developing and contributing to NOMAD, NOT [installing NOMAD](https://github.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad/blob/main/README.md) for regular use! 

### Prerequisites

- A Debian-based OS (Ubuntu 26.04 LTS recommended)
- `sudo`/root privileges
- Docker installed and running
- A stable internet connection (required for dependency downloads)
- Node.js (for frontend/admin work)

### Fork & Clone

1. Click **Fork** at the top right of this repository
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/project-nomad.git
   cd project-nomad
   ```
3. Add the upstream remote so you can stay in sync:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/project-nomad.git
   ```

### Avoid Installing a Release Version Locally
Because NOMAD relies heavily on Docker, we actually recommend against installing a release version of the project on the same local machine where you are developing. This can lead to conflicts with ports, volumes, and other resources. Instead, you can run your development version in a separate Docker environment while keeping your local machine clean. It certainly __can__ be done, but it adds complexity to your setup and workflow. If you choose to install a release version locally, please ensure you have a clear strategy for managing potential conflicts and resource usage.

## Development Workflow

1. **Sync with upstream** before starting any new work. We prefer rebasing over merge commits to keep a clean, linear git history as much as possible (this also makes it easier for maintainers to review and merge your changes). To sync with upstream:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout dev
   git rebase upstream/dev
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch** off `dev` with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/issue-123
   # or
   git checkout -b feature/add-new-tool
   ```

3. **Make your changes.** Follow existing code style and conventions. Test your changes locally against a running NOMAD instance before submitting.

4. **If you touched the AI Assistant or RAG, measure it.** Anything affecting
   chunking, embedding, retrieval, reranking, thresholds, the system prompts, or
   context assembly should be backed by numbers rather than a spot check —
   "it seemed better in the chat window" is how a regression ships. From `admin/`:

   ```bash
   node ace eval:corpus --ingest        # once; safe, never touches your real knowledge base
   node ace eval:retrieval --ablate     # seconds, deterministic, no chat model
   node ace eval:generation --model=<your model> --all-modes
   ```

   Include the before/after numbers in your pull request. See
   [`admin/tests/eval/README.md`](admin/tests/eval/README.md) for what the
   metrics mean, how the three generation modes separate a code bug from a model
   that is simply too small, and the harness's known limitations.

5. **Commit your changes** using [Conventional Commits](#commit-messages).

6. **Push your branch** and open a pull request.

## UI Consistency

NOMAD's guiding principle is that **user-friendliness is paramount**: a control that looks or behaves differently from the rest of the app reads as broken to a non-technical user. New frontend (inertia/React) work should be visually and behaviorally uniform with what is already there. Before adding a UI element, look at its neighbors and reuse the shared building blocks rather than hand-rolling a one-off.

**Reuse the shared components** in `admin/inertia/components/` (and `.../components/inputs/`):

| Need | Use | Not |
|------|-----|-----|
| Binary on/off setting | `Switch` | a raw `<input type="checkbox">` |
| Explanatory hover help | `InfoTooltip` | a raw `title=` attribute or a bespoke tooltip |
| Modal / confirmation dialog | `StyledModal` | a hand-built overlay |
| Text field | `Input` | a bare `<input>` |
| Section heading | `StyledSectionHeader` | ad-hoc heading markup |

Grep for an existing component before building a new one.

**Match the neighbors.** Copy the exact classes and conventions of adjacent elements:

- **Labels:** match punctuation and casing of sibling labels. If the field beside yours reads `Model:` (with a colon), yours should read `Thinking:`, not `Thinking`. Reuse the same typography tokens (e.g. `text-sm text-text-secondary`).
- **Theme:** use design tokens (`text-*`, `bg-*`, `border-*`) so the element works in light and dark mode. Never hardcode colors.
- **Placement:** make sure popovers and tooltips are not clipped or crushed against a viewport edge, including when the trigger sits near an edge of the screen.

**When a raw control is fine.** These conventions are about matching intent, not banning primitives. A raw checkbox is appropriate for a multi-select list or a consent box; radio groups and native selects are fine where a shared component does not exist. The point is to reach for the shared component when your case matches its intent (a binary setting toggle should be a `Switch`), not to eliminate primitives.

**Test UI changes in a real browser.** Most of these conventions are judgment calls that tooling cannot fully enforce, so the single most important habit is to load your change in a browser against a running instance before submitting. Several classes of issue (clipped or cramped tooltips, layout breaking at different window widths, blank-screen render errors) are invisible to type-checking and only show up when you actually look at the page. Check the states that should appear *and* the states that should be hidden, and try more than one window width when layout or positioning is involved.

## Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). All commit messages must follow this format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

**Common types:**

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new user-facing feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation changes only |
| `refactor` | Code change that isn't a fix or feature and does not affect functionality |
| `chore` | Build process, dependency updates, tooling |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |

**Scope** is optional but encouraged — use it to indicate the area of the codebase affected (e.g., `api`, `ui`, `maps`).

**Examples:**
```
feat(ui): add dark mode toggle to Command Center
fix(api): resolve container status not updating after restart
docs: update hardware requirements in README
chore(deps): bump docker-compose to v2.24
```

---

## Release Notes

Human-readable release notes live in [`admin/docs/release-notes.md`](admin/docs/release-notes.md) and are displayed directly in the Command Center UI.

If your PR is merged in, the maintainers will update the release notes with a summary of your contribution and credit you as the author. You do not need to add this yourself in the PR (please don't, as it may cause merge conflicts), but you can include a suggested note in the PR description if you like.

---

## Versioning

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Versions are managed in the root `package.json` and updated automatically by `semantic-release`. The `project-nomad` Docker image uses this version. The `admin/package.json` version stays at `0.0.0` and should not be changed manually.

---

## Submitting a Pull Request
