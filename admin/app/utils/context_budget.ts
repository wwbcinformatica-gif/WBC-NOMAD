/**
 * Decides what actually goes into the prompt, and what gets left out.
 *
 * Before this existed, nothing trimmed anything: the browser posted the whole
 * session, the pipeline copied it verbatim, and overflow was left to the
 * backend. That is the worst possible arrangement, because backend truncation is
 * *silent* and *positional* — llama.cpp drops from the middle of the window, so
 * what gets discarded is conversation history and retrieved knowledge-base
 * context, while the model gives no indication anything is missing. Measured on
 * a live Ollama, a 7,000-token prompt came back having processed 2,060 tokens,
 * and the model confabulated an answer from the fragment that survived.
 *
 * So the rule here is: never hand the backend more than it can hold. Decide
 * explicitly what to drop, drop it in a way the model can reason about, and
 * record what happened so the eval harness can see it.
 *
 * Allocation order, most protected first:
 *   1. Response reserve  — a floor held back for the answer itself. The actual
 *                          generation cap is whatever the window has left once
 *                          the prompt is assembled, which is usually far more.
 *   2. Fixed blocks      — system prompts and the current question. Never dropped.
 *   3. Retrieved context — whole chunks, best-first, until its share is spent.
 *   4. History           — whole turns, newest-first, into whatever remains.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so it runs under bare `node --test`, the same
 * convention as `rag_prompt.ts`.
