/**
 * Stateful splitter for inline `<think>...</think>` reasoning tags.
 *
 * Ollama's native `/api/chat` and its `/v1` shim both surface reasoning as a
 * dedicated field (`message.thinking` / `delta.reasoning`), but other
 * OpenAI-compatible backends (LM Studio, llama.cpp, plain GGUF servers) emit
 * the tags inline in the content stream. This splits them back out so the UI
 * gets a clean `content` channel and a separate `thinking` channel regardless
 * of which backend answered.
 *
 * Lives here rather than inside OllamaService because both transports need it
 * and because it is the only real logic in the streaming path — as a pure
 * class it can be exercised under bare `node --test` with no Ollama, the same
 * reason `rag_prompt.ts` is shaped this way.
 *
 * The hard part is that a tag can be split across chunk boundaries: a chunk may
 * end with `"<thi"`. Any trailing text that could still turn out to be the start
 * of a tag is held back in the buffer and re-examined when the next chunk lands.
