/**

 * is met, never on healthy files, to keep the panel silent in the common case.
 *
 * - `zero_chunks`   — a non-trivial file produced 0 embedding chunks. Common
 *                     cause: video-only or image-only ZIMs that the pipeline
 *                     completes "successfully" with no extractable text.
 *                     AI Assistant cannot reference this content.
 * - `partial_stall` — the file has embedded chunks but well below the count
 *                     expected from the ratio registry. Likely a mid-batch
 *                     stall (which the binary "any chunks ⇒ embedded" check
 *                     used to mask). Surfaces a Retry affordance.
