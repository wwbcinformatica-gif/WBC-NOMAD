# Getting Started with NOMAD

This guide will help you get the most out of your NOMAD server.

---

## System Requirements

If you already have NOMAD running, you can skip this section. It is here for when you are planning a second server, moving to different hardware, or helping someone else get set up.

### Operating System

NOMAD runs on Debian-based Linux.

| Support level | Operating system |
|---|---|
| **Recommended** | Ubuntu 26.04 LTS |
| **Also supported** | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Debian 12 |
| **Community-supported** | Windows via WSL2, other Debian derivatives |

Ubuntu 26.04 LTS is the version we test on and the one we recommend for new installs. If you are already running 24.04 LTS or Debian 12, there is no need to reinstall, both are still supported.

Ubuntu Desktop is the friendlier choice if you are coming from Windows or macOS. Ubuntu Server works just as well if you are comfortable at the terminal, and NOMAD does not need a desktop environment either way since everything is accessed through a browser.

macOS and non-Debian distributions like Fedora or Arch are not officially supported.

### Hardware

NOMAD itself is lightweight. What drives your requirements is the content and tools you choose to install, and whether you want to run AI locally.

**Minimum, without local AI:**

- 2 GHz dual-core processor
- 4 GB RAM
- 5 GB free disk space, plus room for whatever content you download

**Recommended, with local AI:**

- AMD Ryzen 7 or Intel Core i7 or better
- 32 GB RAM
- NVIDIA RTX 3060 or AMD equivalent, more VRAM lets you run larger models
- 250 GB or more of free disk space, preferably an SSD

A stable internet connection is required during installation only. After that, NOMAD is designed to run fully offline.

### A note on GPU drivers

The installer sets up Docker and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit for you, but it does **not** install the GPU driver itself. You need that on the host beforehand.

On Ubuntu, the easiest way is to check **"Install third-party drivers for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware"** during setup. If you skipped that, or you added the GPU later, install the driver first and then use **Force Reinstall** on the AI Assistant in the [Supply Depot](/supply-depot) to pick it up.

Without a GPU, the AI Assistant still works. It just runs on the CPU, which is considerably slower.

## Easy Setup Wizard

If this is your first time using NOMAD, the Easy Setup wizard will help you get everything configured.

**[Launch Easy Setup →](/easy-setup)**

![Easy Setup Wizard — Step 1: Choose your capabilities](/docs/easy-setup-step1.webp)

The wizard walks you through four simple steps:
1. **Capabilities** — Choose what to enable: Information Library, AI Assistant, Education Platform, Maps, Data Tools, and Notes
2. **Maps** — Select geographic regions for offline maps
3. **Content** — Choose curated content collections with Essential, Standard, or Comprehensive tiers

![Content tiers — Essential, Standard, and Comprehensive](/docs/easy-setup-tiers.webp)
4. **Review** — Confirm your selections and start downloading

Depending on what you selected, downloads may take a while. You can monitor progress in the Settings area, continue using features that are already installed, or leave your server running overnight for large downloads.

- How-to guides and survival information
- Classic books from Project Gutenberg

**How to use it:**
1. Click **Information Library** from the Command Center home screen or the [Supply Depot](/supply-depot)
2. Choose a collection (like Wikipedia)
3. Search or browse just like the regular website

---

### Education Platform — Offline Courses (Kolibri)

The Education Platform provides complete educational courses that work offline.

**What's included:**
- Khan Academy video courses
- Math, science, reading, and more
- Progress tracking for learners
- Works for all ages

**How to use it:**
1. Click **Education Platform** from the Command Center home screen or the [Supply Depot](/supply-depot)
2. Sign in or create a learner account
3. Browse courses and start learning

**Tip:** Kolibri supports multiple users. Create accounts for each family member to track individual progress.

### AI Assistant — Built-in Chat

![AI Chat interface](/docs/ai-chat.webp)

NOMAD includes a built-in AI chat interface powered by Ollama. It runs entirely on your server — no internet needed, no data sent anywhere.

**What can it do:**
- Answer questions on any topic
- Explain complex concepts simply
- Help with writing and editing
- Reference your uploaded documents via the Knowledge Base
- Brainstorm ideas and assist with problem-solving

**How to use it:**
1. Click **AI Chat** from the Command Center or go to [Chat](/chat)
2. Type your question or request
3. The AI responds in conversational style

**Tip:** Be specific in your questions. Instead of "tell me about plants," try "what vegetables grow well in shade?"

**Note:** The AI Assistant must be installed first. Enable it during Easy Setup or install it from the [Supply Depot](/supply-depot).

**GPU Acceleration:** If your server has an NVIDIA GPU, NOMAD's installer sets up GPU support for you (it installs the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) and configures Docker automatically). You only need the NVIDIA driver present on the host, which on Ubuntu you get by enabling "Install third-party drivers" during setup. With a GPU, AI responses are dramatically faster (10-20x improvement). If you add a GPU later, go to the [Supply Depot](/supply-depot) and **Force Reinstall** the AI Assistant to enable it.

### Knowledge Base — Document-Aware AI

![Knowledge Base upload interface](/docs/knowledge-base.webp)

The Knowledge Base lets you upload documents so the AI can reference them when answering your questions. It uses semantic search (RAG via Qdrant) to find relevant information from your uploaded files.

**Supported file types:**
- PDFs, text files, and other document formats
- NOMAD documentation is automatically loaded when the AI Assistant is installed

**How to use it:**
1. Go to **[Knowledge Base →](/knowledge-base)**
2. Upload your documents (PDFs, text files, etc.)
3. Documents are processed and indexed automatically
4. Ask questions in AI Chat — the AI will reference your uploaded documents when relevant
5. Remove documents you no longer need — they'll be deleted from the index and local storage

**Use cases:**
- Upload emergency plans for quick reference during a crisis
- Load technical manuals and SOPs for offline work sites
- Add curriculum guides for homeschooling
- Store research papers for academic work

Test your hardware performance and see how your NOMAD build stacks up against the community.

**How to use it:**
1. Go to **[System Benchmark →](/settings/benchmark)**
2. Choose a benchmark type: Full, System Only, or AI Only
3. View your NOMAD Score (a weighted composite of CPU, memory, disk, and AI performance)
4. Create a Builder Tag (your NOMAD-themed identity, like "Tactical-Llama-1234")
5. Share your results with the [community leaderboard](https://benchmark.projectnomad.us)

**Note:** Only Full Benchmarks with AI data can be shared to the community leaderboard.

### Keeping Things Updated

While you have internet, periodically check for updates:

1. Go to **Settings → Check for Updates**
2. If updates are available, click to install
3. Wait for the update to complete (your server will restart)

Content updates (Wikipedia, maps, etc.) can be managed separately from software updates.

**Automatic updates:** NOMAD can also keep itself current without you having to check. Software, installed apps, and content can each be set to update automatically on an opt-in basis, with safety checks and a time window you control. See the **[Updates guide](/docs/updates)** for the full picture.

**Early Access Channel:** Want the latest features before they hit stable? Enable the Early Access Channel from the Check for Updates page to receive release candidate builds. You can switch back to stable anytime.

### Monitoring System Health

Check on your server anytime:

1. Go to **Settings → System**
2. View CPU, memory, and storage usage
3. Check system uptime and status

## Tips for Best Results

### Before Going Offline

- **Update everything** — Run software and content updates
- **Download what you need** — Maps, references, educational content
- **Test it** — Make sure features work while you still have internet to troubleshoot

### Storage Management

Your server has limited storage. Prioritize:
- Content you'll actually use
- Critical references (medical, survival)
- Maps for your region
- Educational content matching your needs

Check storage usage in **Settings → System**.

### Getting Help

- **In-app docs:** You're reading them now
- **AI assistant:** Ask a question in [AI Chat](/chat)
- **Release notes:** See what's new in each version
